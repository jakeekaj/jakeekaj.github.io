I've always had a passion for programming. Back in high school, I was lucky to have a subject on Visual Basic, and this was the first time I was introduced to programming. It was a fun learning experience for me as I built simple interfaces with buttons and fields that interacts with the user. I guess I wasn't really serious about it. I've thought about taking Computer Science in college, but to be honest, the Math terrified me. Don't get me wrong. I'm good at Math, but I had no love for it. I decided to steer away from Math as much as I can, and that's why I ended up taking Development Communication. 

# Back in college
Just to be clear, Development Communication has nothing to do with Software Development. The essence of the program is learning to communicate for social change. I majored in Science Communication which made me really good in popularizing scientific and technical concepts. In other words, I translate these technical concepts to laymens terms. 

The *programming itch* caught up to me in college, and that's why I chose to take a few Computer Science courses just to see where I'm at. The Introduction to Computer Science was taught in C. I did not enjoy that one, to be honest. However, I did have a blast in Object-Oriented Programming, which was done in Java. 

# After graduation
I wanted a programming job back then, but I had to face the reality that no one would hire me as a programmer without a Degree in Computer Science. That was my belief back then, and that's why I ended up working in another industry.

With a decent salary and a relaxed (easy) working environment, I turned on the autopilot switch on my career and I almost lost my passion in programming.  

# 6 years later
Having turned on the autopilot switch for so long, I realized that something's missing in my career. Sure, I did pick up several things along the way. However, I asked myself, *is this what I want to do for the rest of my career?* 

The answer is a big NO. 

I figured that I needed to change something. I need to make a drastic change. It's going to be risky, but it's definitely worth a shot. 

My last job lightly dabbled with front-end web development (HTML & CSS), and that's why I decided to make this the starting point of my new career. With the plethora of online resources, almost anyone can learn to code, if they just put their mind into it. However, this is uncharted waters for me, and that's why I decided to seek the help of real experts. I need a proven learning program to guide me along the way. Thanks to the Flatiron School and their Remote Full-Stack Web Development Curriculum, I am able to reboot my career, and turn off the autopilot switch. 

To code or not to code. That's not a question.
